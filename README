The Mobicents team is glad to announce that Mobicents SLEE 
2.7.0.FINAL, codenamed RAY, is now available for download. 

Release Notes:

The RAY SLEE Core includes not only fixes for several issues, it 
also includes plenty of enhancements, such as: better classloading 
deadlock prevention, configurable default timeout for EventContext 
suspension, optimized sbb entity ordering when routing events 
(which should prevent transaction timeouts due to locks), enhanced 
container state dump logging, enhanced log4j default configurations 
or reworked (activity) event queue managers. This release also 
introduces an additional JAIN SLEE 1.1 extension, which allows SBBs 
to control ACI suspension on attach/detach operations. Please note 
that the default behavior introduced on 2.6.0.FINAL, with respect 
to forced SBB entity removal on service deactivation, was reverted, 
which means Mobicents SLEE will remove existent entities after 1 
minute. Such default behavior is easier for development times, but 
should be changed (to off) on production.

Regarding SIP, the SIP11 Resource Adaptor includes latest JAIN SIP 
RI stack, of version 1.2.170, an easier logging configuration (done 
through log4j), and a few fixes for bugs reported by the community.

With respect to Diameter and SS7, RAY bundles the long waited stable 
releases for these resources, which are of major relevance for today's 
SLEE applications. In concrete, this release includes Mobicents 
Diameter 1.4.0.FINAL and Mobicents SS7 1.0.0.FINAL. All related 
Resource Adaptors have been updated. 

With respect to media control, RAY brings a new release of the MGCP 
Resource Adaptor, due to some fixes on the underlying MGCP stack.

Regarding the bundled application Enablers, RAY brings the first 
stable release for the REST Client enabler.

In the Tools department, we are proud to introduce EclipSLEE 
2.1.0.FINAL, the second stable release of EclipSLEE 2.x, the Mobicents 
JAIN SLEE Eclipse Plugin. This new release now includes an higher 
level wizard for project creation, and adds support for event handler 
methods with custom SBB ActivityContextInterface types and 
EventContexts. As usual, the default versions for maven dependencies 
commonly needed by developers, such as Resource Adaptor Types and 
Enablers, have been updated to match the SLEE components included in 
this release. 

We are also very happy to introduce the second BETA release for the 
SLEE Management Console, now introducing lists of Root SBB Entities 
per service,allowing as well to remove existing SBB Entities, useful 
in development. It also includes fixes for ActivityContext listing 
operations.

Also, new builds of the Jopr Plugin and Remote SLEE Connection tools 
were made, which are needed to ensure full compatibility with the 
changes introduced in RAY SLEE Core.

Finally, with respect the bundled SLEE applications, RAY introduces 
the stable version for the SIP JDBC Registrar, and new releases for 
the standard SIP benchmarking applications, SIP UAS and B2BUA, with 
minor enhancements related with performance. 

Note, this release continues to bundle the unreleased SNAPSHOT of the 
Mobicents Media Server 2.1.0 BETA5, introduced in GHANDI. The team 
worked hard to integrate the recently released Mobicents Media Server 
2.2.0.FINAL, but ultimately decided more time was needed to present 
our community with proper integration.
 
About Mobicents JAIN SLEE:
 
Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x is the first and *only* open source JAIN SLEE
1.1 (JSR 240) compliant platform, a low latency and high throughput
application/service environment for event processing, designed for
stringent requirements of core network signaling application, and to
support scalability and availability through clustering.

The environment provides common behavior to all services:
- Managing component life-cycle (install/activate/deactivate/uninstall)
- Generating traces & alarms, managing resources, user statistics;
- Common behavior is not re-developed for each and every service, the
service developer only cares about service logic

Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x generation represents a major
step forward, introducing major performance/latency improvements. High
Availability and Fault Tolerance features are included , such as fault
tolerant timers, full application state replication, or the Fault
Tolerant Resource Adaptor API, an easy to use API that JAIN SLEE 1.1
resource adaptors can use to work correctly in a clustered
environement. Flexibility is a keyword in the new platform too, JAIN
SLEE profiles are mapped to JPA data sources, and extensive
configuration options can be used to tweak the platform behavior.

Platform management can be achieved through different tools: the
JMX web console giving full access to JAIN SLEE 1.1 and custom
Mobicents MBeans; and the new Jopr ( http://www.jboss.org/jopr )
Plugin, which allows the full JBoss and Mobicents platforms to have a
consistent and unified advanced management and monitoring tool. The 
Twiddle CLI, for quick management of the application server. A SNMP
adaptor is also available in the underlying JBoss AS.
